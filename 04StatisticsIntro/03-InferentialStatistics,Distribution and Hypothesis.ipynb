    "## The study of statistics revolves around the study of data sets. This lesson describes two important types of data sets - populations and samples. Along the way, we'll introduce simple random sampling, the main method used in this tutorial to select samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main difference between a population and sample has to do with how observations are assigned to the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A population includes all of the elements from a set of data.\n",
    "### A sample consists one or more observations drawn from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A measurable characteristic of a population, such as a mean or standard deviation, is called a parameter; but a measurable characteristic of a sample is called a statistic.\n",

    "## Simple Random Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple random sampling is a statistical tool used to describe a very basic sample taken from a data population. This sample represents the equivalent of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The simple random sample is often used when there is very little information available about the data population, when the data population has far too many differences to divide into various subsets, or when there is only one distinct characteristic among the data population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For instance, a candy company may want to study the buying habits of its customers in order to determine the future of its product line. If there are 10,000 customers, it may use choose 100 of those customers as a random sample. It can then apply what it finds from those 100 customers to the rest of its base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statisticians will devise an exhaustive list of a data population and then select a random sample within that large group. In this sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected to be part of the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stratified Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unlike simple random samples, stratified random samples are used with populations that can be easily broken into different subgroups or subsets. These groups are based on certain criteria, then randomly choose elements from each in proportion to the group's size versus the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This method of sampling means there will be selections from each different group—the size of which is based on its proportion to the entire population. But the researchers must ensure the strata do not overlap. Each point in the population must only belong to one stratum so each point is mutually exclusive. Overlapping strata would increase the likelihood that some data are included, thus skewing the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The candy company may decide to use the random stratified sampling method by dividing its 100 customers into different age groups to help make determinations about the future of its production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratified sampling offers some advantages and disadvantages compared to simple random sampling. Because it uses specific characteristics, it can provide a more accurate representation of the population based on what's used to divide it into different subsets. This often requires a smaller sample size, which can save resources and time. In addition, by including sufficient sample points from each stratum, the researchers can conduct a separate analysis on each individual stratum.\n",

    "### Sampling bias means that the samples of a stochastic variable that are collected to determine its distribution are selected incorrectly and do not represent the true distribution because of non-random reasons. Let us consider a specific example: we might want to predict the outcome of a presidential election by means of an opinion poll. Asking 1000 voters about their voting intentions can give a pretty accurate prediction of the likely winner, but only if our sample of 1000 voters is 'representative' of the electorate as a whole (i.e. unbiased). If we only poll the opinion of, 1000 white middle class college students, then the views of many important parts of the electorate as a whole (ethnic minorities, elderly people, blue-collar workers) are likely to be underrepresented in the sample, and our ability to predict the outcome of the election from that sample is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In an unbiased sample, differences between the samples taken from a random variable and its true distribution, or differences between the samples of units from a population and the entire population they represent, should result only from chance. If their differences are not only due to chance, then there is a sampling bias. Sampling bias often arises because certain values of the variable are systematically under-represented or over-represented with respect to the true distribution of the variable (like in our opinion poll example above). \n",
