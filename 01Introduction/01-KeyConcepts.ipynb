Whenever you find an apple you show it to him and say \"apple\" (he says \"blah\"); whenever you find a pear you hold it in front of him and say \"pear\" . To develop the cognitive ability of our genius baby, we diligent parent continue to show him hundreds and thousands of apples and pears over time, and one day magic happen, our Machine baby says \"apple\" when he sees an apple.This is because the baby's brain will use datapoints like size,color and shape to determine the fruit it is \n",
    "He will continue to make mistakes  when a new apple does not look like traditional ones he has seen before but over the time he will make lesser mistakes After some time, the baby will know enough characters of apple to even recognize aged apples or apple slices. We say that he has been trained, or learned, so that now he can do stuff!\n",
