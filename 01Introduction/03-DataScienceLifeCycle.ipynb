    "(i)Predicting Categories- Yes or No Ex:Deciding If an email is spam or not we use 2 Class Classification.For more than 2 possible outcomes we use Multiclass Classification ex which product are you likely to buy on an ecommerce site\n",

    "(ii)Predicting Continous Values - Such as amount of rainfall likely to be recieved at a future date and time or price of stock at a future date or time, we use regression\n",

    "(iii)Unusual Data Patterns - such as unusual temperature readings or unusual Web Access Activity we use Anamoly Detection.\n",
    "<br/>    \n",
    "(iv)Identifying Data Groups - we use K Means Clustering to identify groups set of data points belong to. In a paper recently published by two computer science students at the University of California, Riverside, they are using clustering algorithms to identify fake news based on the content.The way that the algorithm works is by taking in the content of the fake news article, the corpus, examining the words used and then clustering them. These clusters are what helps the algorithm determine which pieces are genuine and which are fake news. Certain words are found more commonly in sensationalized, click-bait articles. When you see a high percentage of specific terms in an article, it gives a higher probability of the material being fake news. \n",
